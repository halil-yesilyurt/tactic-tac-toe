# Tactic Tac Toe ðŸŽ®

**[Tactic Tac Toe](https://halil-yesilyurt.github.io/tactic-tac-toe/)** is a classic tic-tac-toe game built using **React.js** and **Vite** for fast development, with **CSS** for styling. This simple, interactive game lets players edit their names and tracks game logs next to the board, providing an engaging experience for users of all ages.

## Features

- **Two-Player Game:** Supports two players, taking turns with "X" and "O".
- **Player Name Customization:** Players can edit their names before starting the game or even during gameplay.
- **Move Logs:** Every move made by a player is logged next to the game board.
- **Game Over & Draw:** The game automatically checks for a winner. If all spaces are filled and there is no winner, the game ends with a draw message.
- **Rematch Option:** Players can start a new game (rematch) to play again after the game is completed.
